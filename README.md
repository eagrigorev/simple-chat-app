# ðŸ’¬ Messaging App Prototype
That app was made with React.js and intended to highlight various framework tools. It has a built-in Google Firebase backend, Redux, Persist, password protection, third party API, login-register functionality, and so on. The project aimed to emulate a real conversation between users with a delayed message receiving mechanism, which was implemented using a middleware bot as a remote user. I developed that messaging app prototype during my learning React course. To launch that project, execute `npm install` and `npm start`.
