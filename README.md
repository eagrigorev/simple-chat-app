# react-messaging-app-prototype
That messaging app prototype was made with React and intended to highlight various tools of the framework. It has a built-in Google Firebase backend, Redux, Persist, password protection, third party API, login-register functionality, and so on. The project aimed to emulate a real conversation between users with a delayed message receiving mechanism, which was implemented using a middleware bot as a remote user. I developed that messaging app prototype during my learning React course.

To launch that project, you will need to install the following modules via NPM in your IDE:

1. @material/ui-core
2. @testing-library/jest-dom
3. @testing-library/react
4. @testing-library/user-event
5. firebase
6. react
7. react-dom
8. react-redux
9. react-router-dom
10. react-scripts
11. redux
12. redux-mock-store
13. redux-persist
14. redux-thunk
15. web-vitals

After that, run the application: npm start
